# OCR
OCR or Optical Character Recognition is also referred to as text recognition or text extraction. This machine learning based **easyOCR** technique allows user to extract printed or handwritten text from posters, cards, documents, etc. The text can be words, text lines or paragraphs enabling us to have a digital version of scanned text. This significantly eliminates manual entry. The OCR used here is by [**JAIDED AI](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR?tab=readme-ov-file).
